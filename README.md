# birdle
Wordle spinoff where users guess a species of bird each day.

This personal project is in the early stages of development. Current plans are described below:
    - Develop a Python GUI initially, possibly port to a website after
    - Reveal more information about the bird each guess (song, distribution, genus, etc)
        - Inform users if they guessed a bird with a shared characteristic as daily bird
    - Track statistics of returning users
