# Birdle
Wordle spinoff where users guess a species of bird each day.

I plan to initially develop this program using Python; notably, using the tkinter framework. When that is complete, I hope to port the game to a website using React or a similar framework.

## To-Do
- [x] Check and display guesses
- [x] Read bird data from JSON file
- [x] Reveal hints for each guess
- [x] Display list of valid guesses
- [x] Convert submission combobox to smart autofill
  - [ ] Keep autofill open while typing
- [ ] Build MP3 player for song/call hints
- [ ] Track statistics of returning users
- [ ] Reformat code into class structure
- [ ] Revamp UI
