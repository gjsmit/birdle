# birdle
Wordle spinoff where users guess a species of bird each day. This personal project is in the early stages of development. 

### current plans
- Develop a Python GUI initially, possibly port to a website after
- Reveal more information about the bird each guess (song, distribution, genus, etc)
- Inform users if their guess shares characteristics with the bird
- Track statistics of returning users
