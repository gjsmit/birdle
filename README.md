# Birdle
Wordle spinoff where users guess a species of bird each day.

I plan to initially develop this program using Python; notably, using the tkinter framework. When that is complete, I hope to port the game to a website using React or a similar framework.

## To-Do
[x] Check and display guesses
[x] Read bird data from JSON file
[x] Reveal hints for each guess
[x] Display list of valid guesses
[ ] Convert submission combobox to smart autofill
[ ] Build MP3 player for song/call hints
[ ] Track statistics of returning users
[ ] Revamp UI
